Moreso, we, the students, continuously reiterate that WRP is for the wellness of college seniors. It's much better for level 1 and 2 students.

I hope that WRP activities within the week can also be done without a limit so the students can finish their number of hours needed at a fast phase and focus on stuffs that needs more attention.

In addition to this, I objectively believe that limiting student population for afternoon schedules is ridiculous with how taxing it is to commute before sunrise. 

To elaborate: limiting the student population during ""special"" schedules would drive students to wait in the ARH Gym or selected rooms for hours just so they would reach the cut-off number of students allowed to participate in CDF sessions. Of course, there would be students who would wait even at least three hours before the registration period to secure their slots, which would be unfair for students who came in 1-2 hours before the call time who took in the effort to attend CDF sessions. 

I see the genuine intentions to reform the WRP system, however, it just all feels defective and lacking, which just further contributes to the struggles that the students face everyday. This new system felt careless of the stressors that the Tamaraw community goes through. It's like - the system gets it wrong no matter how many attempts the department makes to revamp their policies. Why? Because it does not put the welfare of the students at the forefront. ""Wellness,"" might be the rationale of the program, but that is not what our students acquire from the booking process to the actual physical activities. 

Please bring back the old WRP system and just coordinate with the EdTech to collaborate on how to ensure stability and accessibility of the PowerApps rather than making unnecessary changes that does students more harm than good. Or better yet — remove WRP for 3rd-5th Year students, as most college universities and other higher institutions do with their curriculum. "

What the students asked for is an improvement, not a downgrade with the ""new"" WRP system. I cannot even book one single schedule on the ""new"" app since it displays nothing! Also, my body would not survive taking the morning CDF every day because I live 2 hours away from Manila! With the recent changes, I see that the new WRP system is INCONSIDERATE.

Please do better, please keep in mind the TRUE WELLNESS OF THE STUDENTS.

Also, the stampede that happened earlier this morning (August 16, 2023) due to the walk in CDF should be an eye opener for you the student government and the administration of the school specially the WRP Department.

Moreover, I would like to suggest that they bring back the old policy where students can book thrice a week. This will help students accomplish the needed hours more conveniently. In lieu of this, I hope cancellation of booking slots may be implemented. 

Lastly, for them to remove the new 3 absences only policy. Students are humans with lives outside academics. Emergencies are not a rare occurrence. I hope they take that into account.

The new policy by the deparment right now is not accessible to many students. It is, for the lack of better term, ableist (by oushing students go attend CDF) and does not prioritise the welfare of the institution's students."

Which is why I think it would be best if WRP is only offered for 1st and 2nd year students. (Include 3rd year students if the admin can't be bothered to prioritize the wellness of the students.) Requiring WRP to 4th year students is just insane. I don't care if ""nakayanan"" ng 4th year students before, that's not the point. Either we progress or FEU will forever aim for the top it will never reach. May thesis, ojt, production, and etcetera. WRP is not wellness anymore. 

Prioritize the students. Apply the wellness on WRP. Hindi naman kinakailangan na baguhin ang sistema ng booking, i-improve lang. That's better than the students being the subject of certain experiments. "

1. We are required to follow a strict grooming policy inside and outside the campus. The school not having a room designated room for nursing students to change uniforms is a tough task. We are required to look clean at all times. The wrp being on the same day as our uniform-wearing days risk us from the grooming policy.

2. As someone who finishes wrp early on the semester to not conflict with academic workloads, exams, quizzes, etc. this new fixed system wherein you can only have the freedom to choose one activity of your choice in a week is inconvenient. 

3. As a commuter myself who also has to travel back-and-forth from quezon city to manila, the community dance fitness as top-up activity is ineffective.

4. Lastly, this system has never been expounded nor explained before the enrollment. Everyone has no choice but to enroll to comply with the required units per semester, and yet this new policy has only been given to us when the students already paid for it?

Give a better explanation for the new guidelines (that was announced suddenly and without prior). Better yet, change to the old booking system where students can book 3 activities per week since it is more efficient for students. 

2. Remove the WRP to all 3rd year - 4th year student. These higher year students does not need WRP anymore as they already have a lot on their plate such as board subjects, thesis, OJTs, etc. These academic workloads are more important than the WRP that was already taken from the first two years.

3. Reduce the required hours. The WRP department demands a lot from the students, from the WRP tuition fee up to the required hours. It does not promotes 'wellness' as per the course's goal. 20 hours of activities is too much considering the department's incompetence and lacking of organized and clear announcements. 

4. Open more activities aside from the physical activities that can help the students accomplish the hours needed. Walk-in CDF are not plausible for all students considering not everyone resides in dormitories or live near the campus.

The release of the new wrp program was done too late (at night even), most if not all of us during enrollment decided our schedules with the idea that the schedule in wrp did not matter, especially for freshies who were new to the school. Now, many students who have to travel for hours, have to work, have disabilities were shocked with the changes and strongly hope that their situations are taken into full consideration considering that the changes were abrupt and as students we had the right to know. 

2. Wrp was not prepared when the school year started. Many students who had a monday schedule were so confused and worried on how to reserve for a session. Yes we were given the option of cdf, but again, there are those who have to travel for hours just to take cdf and those who physically cannot opt for cdf. 

3. Many students raised their suggestions and concerns, mainly that it be removed or even just reduced for students in the 3rd and 4th year who have ojt because it is difficult to travel back and forth between school and their ojt , and especially to schedule their times so consistently. 


4. Failed wrp. Failed Wrp can only be taken during the midyear, but a lot of students especially scholars cannot cover the expense of taking a midyear just for wrp, as even the miscellaneous fees are a lot. Hopefully, we are given the option and freedom to take 2 wrp at a time. And the idea of losing our scholarships because of wrp is dismaying because this the only way we can continue our education.

if possible, they should clarify the new guidelines on the fixed schedule, let people book three times a week, clarify how many hours per semester to get a pass (this one also needs to be reduced), make the wrp app more understandable, open more slots, make the walk-in registration easier with tapping a student id instead of writing down names, and remove wrp for 3rd years above.

As an alternative solution to that problem is the Morning CDF, in which I believe not everyone can afford to comply with considering that many of the student population lives in neighboring cities and provinces, to add, the academic load that each of us holds. If the program really aims for wellness, why has its system keeps on getting worse to the point that it imposes overbearing burden to its constituents. It can't be denied by the student body that the WRP has failed us and that the department should do their best to effectively serve its purpose and not change for the worse."

My recommendation is for the requirements to be shortened, and remove the once a week limit of bookings for WRP sessions, to allot more breathing room for the students, especially those in the higher levels, who already have plenty of academic responsibilities on their hands. "

To fill 20hrs of wrp with 1 allotted session per week is nearly impossible especially it's only 1 hr per session, this forcing students to rely on CDF which not everyone can do due to multiple reasons such as work, studies, thesis, etc.  With that amount of hours and that amount of sessions per week, students will be forced to sacrifice a lot of their time that they can use to other courses or work or rest time. Also to repeat another point, 3rd year students and 4th year students already have heavy workloads and difficult courses, if removing wrp for 3rd and 4th year is not possible maybe try to lessen the hours that we need to comply, it would really benefit us as it will create more time for heavy courses or rest time since I believe this years are the most stressful for us due to board exams, multiple research studies etc. 

I understand that the main focus of WRP is the well-being of the students, however, with the current policy it's just making the students even more stressed out, possibly making them more mentally exhausted, and completely opposite to the purpose of this course. I do hope that suggestions like this will be heard and implemented. Just to be transparent, the suggestion is not mine but I wanted to highlight this point because it captured what I think the students needs. 

Also I want to point out that I'm currently having issues with booking, mainly the app is no where to be seen in the Power Apps, which poses a problem for me since I am unable to book any type of session, thus I am unable to fill the hours needed. I also tried to reach out but did not receive a response. Hopefully everything will get resolved. Thank you and stay safe!"

For years, the issue about the WRP system has still not improved and is continuously becoming worse. I am also one of those students who firmly believe that the department should be considerate and remove the WRP to senior students such as the 3rd, 4th, and 5th students as they are busy enough to their clinical duties, OJT, and many more. The weight of having to worry about the needed hours to be completed and sacrificing their only time to rest is truthfully not gaining wellness on their part. Why can’t the department remove this just like other schools? 

Moreover, about the issue of the newly implemented WRP system, I really am disappointed. Giving a fixed schedule for students to book only once a week is unfair as some students prefer to finish the required hours as much as possible to lessen its burden to their academic workloads. Yes, CDF is offered everyday with only LIMITED SLOTS. But  how about those students who have 7:30 am class? How about those who live far away? Not all of the students live nearby and some are also working students. 

Honestly, I prefer the system last semester where we are free to choose whenever schedule we like as we can do WRP activities on our free time which is our vacant to lessen its burden and so we can complete it as quickly as possible. 

I really hope the department would listen to the voice of their students. Thank you."

1. The CDF is unreliable because in my previous experience, I have attended a lot of CDF sessions but only few were credited. 
2. Also, it takes a lot of time before a CDF session is credited. This will make students anxious since we do not know if our efforts to attend CDF were wasted or not.
3. CDF is not recommendable because not everyone can attend to it. For example, not everyone is living in a dorm. I am a commuter, and in order to make it on time for registration for CDF, I have to leave at my house at 4 am. 
* Students are already staying up late due to studying for their academics at home/dorm. For me, I usually sleep around 12 AM because I am a nursing student and I have to put a lot of hours to study for my professional subjects: now, I have to wake up at 3 am to prepare for CDF, then commute at around 4 am. This will only give me roughly almost 3 hours of sleep, and I know most students do the same thing as me. Where is the wellness there? Having to sacrifice little remaining of our sleeping time? Not to mention, it is very unsafe to commute at 4 in the morning.
4. Another issue is even if there is an afternoon walk in, there are limited slots only allotted for that. The student population is way too big, and what we experienced earlier during the afternoon registration for CDF is not a good experience.
* Students were pushing one another because of the first come, first serve registration which can cause a rush. Students might become desperate and it might lead to students pushing/tripping others, causing harm to the other students.
* As for the afternoon registration, not everyone can also attend due to the conflict of schedule.
5. For morning schedule of CDF, it is big a hassle for students who have to wear uniforms especially those who have morning classes (7:30) immediately after CDF, we have no choice but to run to change quickly into our uniforms which should not be rushed since we have to make sure that our uniforms are neat, and that we are presentable (for female nursing students, it takes time for us to fix our hair because our CIs will reprimand us if they see our hair a bit messy. Even when it comes to lukot na uniform, which is what will happen if we are rushed to change into clothes quickly.) 
6. Plus consider the wellness factor, after dancing, we have to run towards our respective buildings which some of them are quiet far. Not everyone can run due to chronic illnesses, disabilities and injuries.

Suggestions:

1. Bring back the old booking system: HOWEVER, there should be a scheduled time for booking in order to avoid bugging/errors but to be fair, that should not be the students’ problem. The system should be improved by edtech/wrp, hindi yung students mismo mag aadjust pa para diyan. 
2. Be more detailed when it comes to releasing information/details about WRP. During the announcement of the new system, most students were confused as to what we should do due to the vague information released to us, leaving us clueless on what the right information is.
3. LESSEN THE HOURS FOR 3rd, 4th and 5th year students! Our loads are already heavy since we are now focusing on our professional subjects. We want more time to focus on our academics rather than put more time for WRP. I understand that we cannot simply abolish the WRP curriculum, but the best is to lessen the hours for 3rd-5th year students.
4. In relation to point 3, this can also help the 1st and 2nd year students so they can have more slot since the 3rd-5th years will have lesser time.


Note: as someone with ADHD, my psychiatrist and I have created a routine that I have been using for a long time to cope with my disability. The new system of WRP has wrecked that routine, and I am having a difficult time in trying to add the new wrp on my routine. Most of my time is spent on commuting and studying, and I would like to focus on my academics because this is a crucial time for me. I’m sure, the same could be applied to other seniors."

IF the WRP department maintains this new system, lessen the required hours to pass WRP. Being allowed to register for only one (1) activity per week prevents students from immediately accomplishing the required 20 hours to pass this course. I, and I am sure other students share this sentiment, want to finish WRP before midterms and finals so that I can focus on academic work.

2. Provide more walk-in activities alongside the current online booking system. This can help students who struggle with the volatile MS Power Apps, and it can encourage more students to attend as there would be one less hurdle to simply walking to a venue and doing WRP activities. HOWEVER, state that the first walk-in attendee must keep track of the participants to prevent overbooking. MOREOVER, having the WRP activity facilitator present at least 15 minutes before the allotted time will help prevent the issue of overbooking.

3. Abolish WRP. Regular PE classes are perfectly fine and let the third and fourth-year students focus on their OJTs, internships, and dissertations."

The WRP Department should have released the full guidelines before the enrollment for this semester started. That way, students would've been able to enroll into their desired schedules and treat WRP like a course. It could've also reduced the number of students who are panicking about the new WRP system out of fear that they won't meet the required hours. The WRP department needs to learn how to properly disseminate information, instead of relying on word-of-mouth, therefore risking the spread of misinformation and leaving FEUCSO and student councils to respond to the grievances of students.
2. Although WRP only takes up 1.5 units, students should've been allowed to have two days in their fixed schedule, much like how blended learning courses (e.g. Understanding the Self) occupy two days in students' schedules despite only having synchronous classes once a week. I understand that turning WRP as a once-a-week course with a fixed schedule was recommended by FEUCSO to reduce the traffic in the WRP app. However, there is no assurance that there will be no shortage of slots using this new system, as the WRP department and the developers of the WRP app instilled distrust on the students of FEU."

In the last semester, students can attend up to 3 sessions per week and fit it on any schedule as they please, and yet some still found it hard to complete the required hours to pass. If this is the case, what makes the department think that limiting it to 1 booked session per week in a fixed time slot will increase the passing rate? The 'mandatory' CDFs? WRP boasts a ""wide selection"" of activities but it seems that we are left with no choice but to attend CDFs regardless if we have early morning classes or not.

Bring back the old system of booking BUT improve it. Do not put a limit on the sessions that students can book for a week, so they can finish as early as they would like. With this, expand available activities because they already have the resources. Wasn't the Arts Building specifically made to cater new WRP activities? 

Move out bookings outside of powerapps because it is UNRELIABLE and SLOW, instead make a website similar to Student Central. 

Abolishing and removing WRP from the curriculum would be unattainable. As far as I know (please do verify this), it is stated in a CHED memorandum that college students must complete 12 units of PE before graduating. For most universities, they take 3 units of PE per semester and the 12 units are completed in the 2nd year so as not to interfere in the OJT and thesis of 3rd and 4th years. FEU made a stupid and impractical decision to disperse the 12 units in 4 years by making us take 1.5 units per semester. In turn, it is affecting 3rd and 4th year activities. The least they could do to provide some sort of compensation to upperclassmen is to LESSEN THE HOURS. "

- Improve the system of booking a session. Power Apps poorly performs (whether it be booking, or reflection of earned/ credited points).

This course should only be for 1st and 2nd years as the workload of the students increase as they reach 3rd, 4th, and 5th year. It is during these last few years that students should be preparing for board exams, thesis, and graduation. If you really want to ensure the wellness of the upperclassmen, make it optional instead of mandatory for them. 
2. It has been evident to cause students more stress than wellness as the system drastically changes per semester without actually considering what changes are being asked for by the students. 
3. Why can't the # of hours be reduced? Especially if only 1 booked session is allowed per week? Have they done the math for this change? And CDF is not the solution for this as the university does not have a venue big enough to cater all students taking WRP (1st-5th years) nor is it considered ""wellness"" if the students are forced to participate in an activity they don't particularly like and in a crowded area no less.
4. The WRP Personnels need to have a refresher course in professionalism in the workplace. The WRP department has a reputation of being rude and dismissive of students' concern.
5. Not all students have 24/7 access to internet. Find a way to offer students an option of booking classes without the need for internet and applications. "

Let's all be realistic, and let's not make fool of each other around. It would be literally hassle for all the students to attend Community Dance Fitness (CDF) every morning. Not all student could afford to attend the CDF every morning since most of us will came from different places, or most of us will start our first class at afternoon. Will it make sense to go to school as early as 6:00 am just to attend this session and wait a very long time for our next class? Just like for example, my first class every Tuesday starts at 4:30 pm. If I would be attending CDF every Tuesday, I will waste 9 hours on campus waiting for my next class. Also, it would be impossible for us to complete the required hours for us to pass the WRP if we will all just rely on 1 booking per week. Additionally, we all know that if this new system would push through, it would be impossible to cater all the students that will attend the said program. Furthermore, these new system seems like pushing student to attend CDF rather than other activities. It would be good if instructors would immediately input the credits of students. But we all know that this would be impossible with yhe new guidelines because for sure, hundreds of students will be attending this for the sake of passing the WRP. 

On my last note, to the one who suggested and implemented this new guidelines, kindly please re-assess if this new system provides ""WELLNESS"" and ""RECREATION"" to students, or it is just becoming more burden on the sides of students, particularly to those higher levels who would be having their ojt or internship program outside the campus."

Thus, the department can still implement a feasible system through fixed schedules and remove the number of hours required. Activities are also fixed, but they also change every week of classes. Similarly, it is like an academic course that a student should attend at their chosen schedule in their portal; furthermore, the number of absences is still implemented.

Or why revise it into a way where students (and I believe even teachers/facilitators) will have a more difficult time to attend/cope to?

This has been a pressing concern even way before I enrolled in FEU. I am strongly dissatisfied on how the system works in this subject. If I, as a freshman, am already terribly afraid that the alloted time I have to book and attend the WRP Course/s might not be enough, what more for our seniors? Especially the ones who are in their internships, or those who are working students, people who travel far from the university, or any at all?

I am a BSMT student which makes my courses NOT LIGHTWEIGHT at all. The new WRP process certainly is:

1.) not student friendly re: schedules;
2.) not serving the main purpose or goal of the program;
3.) inconsiderate to the general well-being of the studentry, and;
4.) a huge HASSLE.

I advocate for BEST revisions for the betterment of the FEU Community on WRP. If it is the department’s aim to make WRP lasting to the students’ minds, then it SHALL serve its purpose in a rightful manner.

It is just JUST for the department to provide the positive changes that can give the students the better option to study and at the same time prioritize WRP.

In this sense, the students are DYING just to comply for the 1.5 hours per session just to pass WRP. Please, do better! Either bring back the old process OR commit to your revisions and INSTANTLY make it organized for all institutions and year levels! Please.

Hear the studentry! Professionally COORDINATE with FEUSCO! Formally address our concerns and give RIGHT solutions!

1. CDF should have mornings and afternoon it can be MONDAY, WEDNESDAY AND FRIDAY if this is implemented. If not, CDF should be everyday only in mornings like last semester. 
2. IMPROVE POWERAPPS. Just improve powerapps instead. Bring back the booking thrice a week. 
3. It is impossible most of us to reach 27 hours this semester if 1 booking per week and the rest CDF to fill the hours. Not all of us are free all the time (especially in the time slot we enrolled) in the morning to join CDF. There are students who do not have dorm and they just commute. You cannot expect them (us) to leave home early just to join 6:30 pre-registration for CDF. That’s exhausting.
4. The enrolled time slot we have can be the time/date we can book in powerapps . But of course, 3 times a week per booking."

But, the WRP department  didn’t execute this well. This was announced after the enrollment period, which most of students, especially us working students, thought that is was just a dummy schedule. Ever since, WRP has been a pain to think about, because of the system that we have on previous semesters, and now this, WRP has to be so inconvenient for us. The complicated and not-so-confirmed guidelines makes us overthink even more. Last, if this is the final implementation of the WRP department, can they at least lower the required hours for physical activities to avoid failure for this subject. Attending once a week is not applicable for some students and CDF walk-ins in the morning is just not practical because not all of us live near campus, and most of us are WORKING STUDENTS. "

Please factor in the fact that not everyone has the privilege of living near the campus. A huge part of the student population has to leave home as early as 4am and wake up at an even earlier time to travel for something that isn’t guaranteed to be credited (due to weather or registration time). Moreover, there are unexpected events that may happen such as the common cancellation of classes or holidays that could instantly cut the number of weeks we can register if we are unable to attend cdf (i.e Monday and Friday groups that instantly lost 2 possibly registered sessions just this month).

it is a waste of time and money, more importantly does not contribute to the overall wellness of the students.

Also, sometimes when going to school as early as I could, and then the weather (specifically when it rains) the CDF actually auto-credits some of the required units of WRP, however us students still needs to rush and sign-up our names to be accredited, but I have seen experiences from past students that sometimes the units/hours that students availed from the CDF was not completely accredited due to some circumstances (specifically lost of sheets and not being encoded to the system) efforts of the students such as myself, did not just waste money but my time to attend the required assessment. This also takes up concerns specifically to medical students such as myself a Nursing student where grooming are strictly implemented for students, there are also no enough changing rooms for students when its needed to comply for the grooming rules of our department.

However, the number of WRPs that can be booked per week is limited to one and some students prefer to finish the required hours as early as possible, which the new WRP guidelines make it not possible for them. 

Also, considering students with OJT and are working, the new guidelines became a problem for them since these were released after enrollment so all of us were not informed and thought that the WRP slot in our schedules is just a dummy one.

You can bring back the 3 bookings per week and have CDF both in the morning and afternoon sessions with a limit of 200-250 students so there will be more slots that can accommodate all the FEU students. Adding WRP sessions such as sign language class (a recommendation by a student in one of our pages), creative academic-related class (could be essay-writing or creative writing classes), or anything skills honing classes (could be leadership classes? or debates?) are some of the suggestions that can help add more slots and make it inclusive for people with disabilities for WRP. There are WRP classes where we can collaborate with our very own organizations that is related to these classes and also promote them to other students and make these classes like a ""teaser"" to what happens in each organization."

Gusto ko umattend ng CDF sa umaga kaso 7:30 po siya natatapos, eh start na rin po yun ng klase namin. Hindi naman po agad-agad nakakapagsign-out kasi marami. Possible po bang ma-utilize ang pag-tap nalang ng ID para sa sign in at sign out? Kapag sa hapon naman po na CDF, conflict pa rin sa schedule ko. Wala na po akong choice kundi yung fixed schedule. Mapipilitan po ako na gabihin kasi ayun lang ang oras na pwede mag WRP. I have no classes naman po in other days, kaso is it really worth it na bumiyahe nang malayo para mag WRP? Mahal na rin po ang pamasahe. Pwede rin po ba na gawing online yung ibang activities para sa mga 3rd-5th year (kahit wala pang internship yung iba)?

To summarize lang po:

- clarify the guidelines
- babaan required hours/gawing online yung ibang activities para sa lahat ng upperclassmen
- ID tap-in for CDF registration
- additional possible activities na pwedeng macredit under WRP

It is essential for institutions to prioritize effective communication by avoiding last-minute announcements of changes and providing clear guidelines well in advance, ideally before the commencement of the academic year. Late notifications can lead to confusion, frustration, and disrupt the learning process for students. By offering transparent information and instructions ahead of time, educational organizations can foster a smoother transition, allowing all stakeholders to adequately prepare and adapt to the upcoming changes, ultimately creating a more positive and productive learning environment. 

Also, I suggest that if you changed the policy to just once per week booking, you guys should also adjust the required hours to pass WRP. Be genuinely student centered."

WRP should be removed to give additional units to professional subjects in need of more time for knowledge depth for all programs. For the Medical Technology program, I recommend prioritizing the courses such as Histology, Cytogenetics, Molecular Biology & Diagnostics, or subjects that only have 1 hr of lecture time. (Consult with every department to implement this). Bear in mind that students enrolled to the university to focus on their specific programs.

2.) Seek a new provider that would offer an effective booking system. Power Apps is not an effective application for booking, especially in a flawed system.

3.) The number of hours should be lessened for 3rd year and above levels which usually focuses on their professional courses (which again, the subjects that the students reason for enrolling based on their chosen program)

4.) The current WRP system does not offer flexible hours for students to participate in while attending their classes. Especially, it is near impossible to achieve the minimum hours required in less than 18 weeks while considering class suspensions due to activity periods, emergencies & storm surges.

5.) If the booking system cannot be fixed at the time, I suggest avoiding advanced booking. Instead, when students wish to attend a certain activity on the list, they would  go to the specified venue and will only book by then. In this case, it would be called ""apply"". 
• Once the student is present in the venue and submitted their application for the activity, they will present this to the instructor/moderators.
• On the instructors' end, it should be ""admitted"" first before allowing the student to participate in the activity.
• Once done with the activity, proceed to roll call and immediately grade the students (*bookings/applications prior to the activity or within the time without the physical confirmation of the instructors/ moderators should be nulled before proceeding with the activity).
* this would lessen network traffic since students are assured that they have various activities to attend during the period.

6.) In consideration of #5, an increase of student capacity, depending on how rigorous the activity should be considered."

So why are they insinuating that aside from the session booked online, we attend the morning or afternoon CDF? DECREASE THE MINIMUM HRS REQUIRED. HEAR THE STUDENTS. "

Because obviously somehow it makes the students finished their WRP hours faster. And it is manageable in a way that it allows the students book any time they prefer. What we are voicing out is an alteration of the application used for online booking because it is crashing all the time.

If the new guidelines can’t be change, then atleast the department should:
1. Allow walk-ins during the fixed time slot other than online booking
2. Provide more time sessions for CDF in consideration for students who commute, work, upperclassmen, etc.
3. Make the CDF/Online registration more efficient 
4. Cater the amount of students that they can handle

Concerns:
1. How many times are the students allowed to join CDF in a week? 
2. Is the 3 times a week guideline still applicable? 
3. For instance, my fixed time slot is on Tuesday. Am I still allowed to join CDF in that day?
4. What is the required hours for WRP this semester? Is it still the same?

I hope that you take this in consideration because we need clarifications ASAP and for us to plan and comply with the requirements. Thank you."

- Honestly, okay na po yung 20 hours (for it to be consistent) within a fixed or not schedule, but hoping that you can consider na tanggalin na siya totally for 3rd-4th yr (or more than depending on the program/course chosen by the students) since given na I am one of the students under the medical field, siguro naman po enough na yung clinical applications (including internships and any other physical and mental working attributes) which I think is part pa rin ng pagiging Recreational but more focus na nga lang sa course, as long as gumagalaw katawan mo, reflexes, and utak ng isang tao. Also, pagod na rin students due to numerous reasons (inevitable or not)
so parang pproblemahin pa yung WRP which is a minor subject (no offense). 

- Ahead of time, sana po inannounce na agad yung new system like before pa lang magstart yung classes nang na-aaddress na po agad yung mga issues or any clarification needed.

Very counterintuitive kasi ang main concern namin ay hindi kami makapagbook ng enough hours tapos ang response ay to limit it from thrice to once a week pero ganun pa rin ang required hours?
- At this point, ang only hope nalang ng students to surely secure their credit hours ay CDF na 6:30 am ang registration tapos unahan pa so obviously kailangan mas agahan para pumila. Pano naman yung walang dorm and 2 hours minimum ang commute? Let's say 4 am ang byahe pero anong oras mo kailangan magising? 3 am? May CDF sa afternoon but it can only accommodate 150 slots so kailangan talaga wala kang class before para makapila ka nang maaga, leaving us with no choice but to resort to cutting some classes in order to prioritize our wrp schedule just like what we have to do for the past semesters.
- When we called for a fixed schedule, what we meant ay 3 unit fixed schedule class with a fixed assigned professor just like any normal PE class.
- It does not make sense din na we have to take it every semester na nga tapos until we graduate pa. 
- If you're really adamant sa booking system, then lessen the required hours and offer more afternoon slots to both online booking and walk-in registration.

If WRP is still required for 3rd year students and above, then have a lower requirement of hours (such as 12 hours instead of 20) for 3rd year students and above, as according to the curriculum of my program (BSA), it involves subjects directly connected to one's chosen program and requires more time to read and review ahead of time (3rd year), or is allotted for internships and integrated exams in preparation for board exams (4th year) which means there is not much time left either rest or have time to book sessions for 20 hours.

2. Make reservations for WRP back to 3 per week or at least 2 per week

3. Have UAAP games and other bonus activities creditable 

4. Include weight training as a WRP activity

Also, limited activities, what if the volleyball and basketball are only left  and I am physically not fitted to those kind of activities… what am I gonna do and that only is the given schedule because of the new system.

The current system only favors students who do not have any non-academic responsibilities (e.g. students who do not have jobs and orgs) and those who are able to enroll a slot that is most convenient to them (because most students were not aware that the current system did not treat the schedule as a “dummy schedule” upon enrollment.) the wrp office should be open and transparent with FEUCSO since they represent the students of FEU and LISTEN to the students concerns rather than creating a bigger problem for them and the students. The new system will fail many students. If they want to make the new system work, they must minimize the required credits to pass the subject."

Bring back the old system. 

       As someone who lives 1.5 hrs away and as someone whose last class is 9:00 pm, it is not making me healthy at all unlike last school year. Due to this new system, I lack sleep which makes me sleepy during class hours—I get home before 11:00pm and will be able to sleep before 12:00 am, the next day, I will need to wake up by 4:00 am to leave the house by 5:00 am to prevent from being late for the CDF registration. 
 
        In total, I get less than 5 hrs of sleep daily. Knowing that we are still in the beginning of the semester, what will happen to us in the middle of the semester then? 

        Please, if you still have conscience in your body, lend it to student commuters like us because I know that I am a responsible WRP student when there is a just system (I had more than 26 hours of activities during the first semester of SY '22-'24 and passed the WRP during the second term of the said SY).  

        Most importantly, it used to be one of my favorite things here in FEU but sadly, it is now the cause of anxiety of many students here.  

P.S. As a nursing student, my professor taught us that this type of routine leads to sickness and not health. Funny how the institution is the cause of it. Now, I understand why students from other universities saw this institution as 'something I would not prefer to say'. 

  
Thank you."

I live in Bulacan, I travel a total of 5-6 hours a day just to attend my afternoon til night classes. I cannot afford registering to walk-in activities as they are very early. I also can say the same for special afternoon walk-ins as is is time for my classes. 

It would be better if we can also still book 3x a week just like the previous WRP guidelines last semester as not every student could attend limited walk-in WRP sessions very early in the morning. It would also give us the chance to freely choose when to do WRP when our workload is light. The walk-in activities tend to cause “riots” as students are desperate for slots, only causing harm."

Also further clarification for the system would be a great help, for a reason that we are not fully oriented with the subject, as the orientation (Tatak Tamaraw) only focused on telling the students WHAT a WRP is and not HOW to navigate and basically complete the required credit hours for WRP.

Concern:
My concern lang why changed the previous WRP rule to new WRP that we have today a many of students are still struggling to understand the new rule because of what you added a new rule without giving us a PROPER explination literally on the first day of class you posted the new policies without giving us a proper explanation and have headups during our summer break that your changing WRP rules. For my second concern is that why are will still taking WRP on 3rd & 4th you know that we are currently taking MAJOR class. Why not completely remove it so that we can focus more on our majors, even though the class has started and still on the orientation week but still. A lot of my prof already discussed what are going on our 1st sem and i can say its very heavy coming from a studio art student on who focus more on the traditional art and also i can say that the WRP we will not able focus on it since we are more focus on our majors. For my third concern is the limation of booking we have this problem since last school year for what the new rule is im gonna predict that we will have the same problem on the booking. You do realise FEU have many students currently enrolled diba and you expect by putting a limations will solve our problem pero notting change we are struggling talaga. Put a limation only the thing that u feel needs a limation but not on CDF & PE this are the mostly probly a lot of students will book on.

•completely remove WRP on 3rd & 4th

The original allure of WRP in FEU was that students could book activities in times they wanted. In times that they are free. Out of all the added rules on WRP, the limited absences is the most reasonable, as some students are joy bookers and does not attend activities. On the other parts, it seems to worsen the situation of WRP. If would have been if they:
(1) Announce early about changes or possible changes in the system. As this concerns the students, we must know what is happening on the courses we are taking. From past WRPs, the students assumed that the schedule is still tentative, thus, some students simply enrolled on a schedule without knowing what that really mean. Plus, clear instructions should have been stated. Is there still an hour limit per week? Does the target time remain? When could students book online?
(2) Instead of limiting the number of booked activities to one (1), it could be possible to limit students, who passed the 20 hour mark, from booking more activities. Thus, more students can book.
(3) Fixed schedule creates unfairness for students who have a schedule on a specific day, but that day is a holiday (e.g. consecutive Mondays are holidays).
(4) If it is possible, then be stricter on students who INTENTIONALLY do not finish WRP.

If the current system remains then:
(1) If the department insists on promoting CDF, then make it more accessible for every student. Not everyone has the time in the morning to commute early as some lives far from school.
(2) Announce early if the CDF will continue for the day. It was stated that auto-credit will no longer be done even if it rains. The weather is unpredictable, thus, regardless if it rains, the students will still come to school early just to show up IN CASE there is CDF (just like what happened earlier, August 17).
(3) Based from the incident earlier, CDF could not accommodate large number of students and the walk-in registration process is a bit chaotic. It was obvious how this new procedure was not prepared well enough as the process from simply registering was not handled well. If the department limited online booking to only one per week, then the alternative (CDF) is the students’ only salvation (as 1.5 hours a week takes 2x the normal duration of 4.5 hours a week).
(4) Create better guidelines for CDF.

The above were stated with “without the need to create a new curriculum” in mind. As it was stated in OPC that the possibility of removing WRP for 4th years could only be lobbied because it would create/revise the current curriculum. Then maybe, some stated above is feasible with the current curriculum."

And pinaka convenient talaga ang 2018 curriculum lalo na sa working students hindi sila mahihirapan mag reach ng 20hrs credit para lang makapasa.

Ang maayos lang sa new system ng wrp is yung strict na sila sa attendance mahirap makipag agawan ng Sched tapos hindi rin naman pala papasok yung iba

The WRP program became even more of a hassle for students. 1 booking per week is not enough for everyone to comply. I came from Makati City and had to wake up at 3:00 A.M. in the morning just to get on the first trains of both MRT and LRT to get to the registration for the morning session of CDF on time. Should there any unexpected occurrences arise, I wouldn't be able to reach on time and would risk failing WRP. 

I should also add that I have classes that end at 7:30 P.M. 
I have to travel from campus back to my home in Makati City and it would take 1 hour and 30 mins and I usually arrive at home around 9:00 P.M. 
I mostly go to bed around 11:00 P.M. because I still have to study for tomorrow's classes or do any chores that I am supposed to do around the house which would only leave me with 4 hours of sleep which is not healthy. I already tried doing this and I felt dizzy on the road to the point that I thought I would pass out. My mother doesn't have any money to get me a dorm which is why I always have to travel. 


SUGGESTION: 

If the WRP office still want to pursue the fixed WRP schedule, please make the schedule similar to our GEDs and major subjects - there should be two fixed schedules of the same time enrolled. That way, even though students couldn't make it to the morning session of CDF, they wouldn't feel bothered too much about failing since they can rely on their fixed schedules. 


I hope my concerns would be heard and my suggestion is taken into consideration. 
Thank you. "

Concerns:

1.) I am a PWD po. I really understand po ung iba na gusto mag board games and music and lyrics para di sila pagpawisan. Pero un nalang po ang pinaka okay na ma bbook ko dahil sa physical disability ko po. May mga natitira naman pong slots for board games and music and lyrics, pero tumatama po sya sa class schedule ko po na may klase. I hope u understand that po.

2.) I'm confused po na para saan pa po ung medical namin before enrollment po nung freshman po ako kung ang demand po ng wrp is more physical activities? Music and lyrics nalang po talaga pag asa ko kasi credited po sya as physical activity din po.

3.) Marami po akong kilala na bumagsak sa wrp po na kapwa ko PWD, isa po doon ay may epilepsy at asthma. Nakakalungkot lang po na hindi po kame priority or kahit man lang po consideration for PWDs na hindi kaya ang hours na need na physical activities po. 

4.) I really want to try din po some physical activities, pero ang concern ko po is what if matamaan ako ng kapwa student ko na gusto lang naman po pumasa sa wrp? I don't want po na may biglang accidents na mangyayare at masisisi pa po ung kapwa ko po student. 

5.) Some says na ""mag ingat ka nalang"" or ""gawin mo nalang"" i know di lang po ako nakakafeel neto na dahil po sa wrp, gagawin mo ung bagay na un para lang pumasa sa wrp. Maraming nag ssacrifice bumyahe ng maaga, pumunta sa school ng 5am for CDF. I hope hindi lang wellness ang matanggap namin, sana peace of mind din po.

Questions:
1.) Is there any PWDs friendly po na activity na pwede pong ma credit as physical activity?

2.) Possible po bang madagdaggan ng choices of activities para sa mga students not just for pwds?

3.) Possible po kaya mailapit sa wrp department mga concerns din po ng PWDs?


Suggestions:
Lagi naman po laman ng OPC is ayusin ung app. Pero po feeling ko mag kakaproblem ulit ung app sa mga susunod na buwan lalo na kapag marami nag bbook. 
 1.) Instead po na 3, sana po pwede gawing 4 po na pwede mag wrp per week.
2.) Aside po sa powerapps, sana po sa page ng wrp mag labas sila ng form 3 times a day for activities na available lalo na po kapag nag loko ung app.
3.) Dagdagan po choices of activities.
4.) Sana di lang po panonood ng UAAP sana may ibang choices din po.

I know po na puro PWDs laman ng concern ko pero di lang naman po ito para saakin, para din po sa mga nakikita kong nahihirapan na students at sa mga nakikita ko pong kapwa ko pwd. I have Mandible po sa Face ko, titanium po sya, kapag natamaan po ung bakal po sa face ko, this might cause a LOT po. If nabalitaan  nyo po ung sisikan last time sa CDF at tulakan, un po iniiwasan ko huhu. This is not just for me po ah but also for my kapwa PWDs na hindi kaya and need na physical activities. I hope po makarating po ito sa inyo. Sana po maayos na po :(((

I hope the concerns po ng students ay umabot po sa wrp department, thank you feucso!"
